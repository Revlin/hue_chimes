Purpose:

  The display is of colored bars or stripes which each represent a segment of a piece-wise linear sine-wave (each of the pieces is a little sine-wave segment). The frequency of each segment is visually represented by the hue of the bar. The lowest hue value, arbitrarily chosen to be red, is the fundamental frequency. All preceding hues are multiples (harmonics) of the fundamental. This program allows for 127 harmonics above the fundamental frequency. The frequency chosen for the fundamental is fixed at the moment, but I plan on adding an initial selection of fundamental frequencies as I further develop this app.

Progess:

  At this point the colored bars are fully implemented and touchable, but there is no audio framework, thus there is no audio. I will be working on this from late spring into summer 2012 and updating accordingly.

Have fun,
Rev
